Following is the sequence of events that occur when using the advisor

A = advisor
U = user

A: Present spec screen to user.

U: Enter known specs.
   Press "Suggest Device".

A: Perform preliminary sanity check. This is a series of quick checks that
   will occur before the advisor starts doing any serious computation. This saves
   time by reporting obvious inconsistencies to the user early on. An possible
   sanity check would be to ensure that the output power isn't higher than the
   input power.


*** 
*  A: Sanity checks fail. Report failure to user along with how to fix it.
*	
*  U: Make required changes to specifications.
*** 

A: Upon sucess of all sanity checks, start to solve the system.


*** 
*  A: No solutions are possible, determine the "best" constraints that the
*       user should relax. These constraints are found using heuristics.
*       Report the failure to design a device to the user. In this report, provide
*       detail about why it failed and the "best" constraints determined
*       previously.
*
*  U: Make changes to specifications.
*** 


***
*  A: More than one design is ties for best. In this case, there are likely an
*     infinite amount of best solutions due to parameters being on a continuum.
*     This provides an excellent oportunity to allow the user to specify
*     additional constraints such as "keep cost as low as possible".
*     If it is found that no extra constraints can reduce the solution space
*     without brining it to zero, don't bother informing the user until the final
*     results screen.
* 
*  U: Add extra constraints if desired.
***

A: Present final design to user. In the case of multiple designs, present them
   all.

U: Rejoice!
