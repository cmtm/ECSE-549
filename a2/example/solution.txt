== Knowledge 

This section specifies what kind of knowledge we need to represent for each
category. This document isn't supposed to contain knowledge statements, but is
just supposed to contain what kind of knowledge from each category will be
used in the implementation.

=== Knowledge from requirements

Specifications of the actuator. This includes physical dimensions and working
conditions.

=== Knowledge from environment

None (or size constraints).

=== Knowledge from external source

Theory of how actuators work. Different actuator examples and their important
parameters.

== Representation

Example devices will be examined and one closest the the desired
specifications will be selected as a reference.

A physical representation of the device will be created. The physical shape
and motion will be modeled using know physical equations.

== Solution processes

Starting from the example device, the parameters will be changed until the
specifications meet the desired ones.
