= Knowledge concepts an solution processes document

== Knowledge 

This section specifies what kind of knowledge we need to represent for each
category. This document isn't supposed to contain knowledge statements, but is
just supposed to contain what kind of knowledge from each category will be
used in the implementation.

=== Knowledge from requirements

This is related to the user requirement document.

=== Knowledge from environment

This is related to the system constraints document.

=== Knowledge from external source

Much knowledge used in designing a solution is external to the design itself.
Thing like laws of physics, standards and heuristics fall into this category.
It's a bit of a catch all if you will.

== Representation

How will all the knowledge be represented in a cohesive way.

== Solution processes

Once the knowledge is represented in a cohesive way, an algorithm is run over
it in order to produce a design (or a solution to the problem). This algorithm
is described in this section. Common algorithms can consist of equation solvers or
rules engines.
