= Available resources document

== Time constraints

Describe the possible timelines for the project.
Do certain deadlines need to be met?
This not only includes the timeline of the design, but also the prototyping,
testing, scaling, finished result, etc.

== Human resources

Describes the various human resources available for the solution.

=== Administrative

=== Design

=== Implementation

=== Miscellaneous

== Non-human resources

All resources available to the project besides humans are included here.

=== Design tools

These can be software tools, like a software compiler or CAD software.
They can also be physical things such as computers, video conferencing setups,
even office stationary if one feels the need to specify it (e.g. blueprint
paper).


=== Prototyping resources

This is anything available for creating the prototype of the product. Examples
could be machine shops or 3D printers.

=== Testing infrastructure

What kind of testing setup is available. The nature of this infrastructure can
vary greatly based on what is to be designed. For a software project, the
testing infrastructure could be an automated build and test system. For a
physical design such as a car, testing might involve a driving course or crash
testing facilities.

=== Implementation resources

Once designed, the implementation itself needs resources. If it's a mass
manufactured solution, entire factories with automated assembly lines could go
in this section.

Smaller scale designs might just need workshops.
